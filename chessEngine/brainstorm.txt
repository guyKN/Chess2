A capture is worth it if:
1. It is capturing a more valuable piece, or an unprotected piece
2. It is capturing an equally valuable piece, and after capturing the piece, the see without the piece is worth it

Things to do with see and move ordering:
1. check if a capture is worth it. If it's worthwile, put it in front of the move order. Use mvvlva to order winning captures.
If it's a neutral capture, put it lower but still high. Losing captures go way later.
2. See if a move leaves a piece hanging. Put those moves at the very end of the list.
3. See if a moves threatens a piece which could be captured, and then put it higher on the list.
For these sorts of moves, also place a flag on that square, and put earlier on the list moves that defend or move that piece or capture the attaking piece.
Also maybe check for potential forks
